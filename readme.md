## Solution to AWS Lambda Hackathon

**More details on the hackathon challenge**: https://github.com/LambdaSharp/June2018-ApiGateway

**Solution**: The solution is tested and working, but, in order to be implemented in other AWS accounts, you need to do some configurations and additional steps in AWS (S3/API/IAM). These are all detailed in the hackathon challenge (see URL above).
 1) Follow the hackathon instructions to configure AWS
 2) Upload 'todos.js' to your AWS Lambda
 3) Fill 'config.js' values inside <> with your AWS configurations, and upload this file to your AWS Lambda
 4) Test it (it is very useful to console.log() in the Lambda function for debugging)
